An extremely simple foreground/background audio/video player for Android devices based on the Jetpack Media3 library.

## Project Goal
The goal is to create an extremely simple audio/video player that works seamlessly in both foreground and background, without requiring users to tap buttons, scroll lists, or navigate through complex menus. Users can start the app, select a media file using a standard file browser, and once started, the player will continue to function until the media finishes or is manually stopped, even if the screen is turned off.

## Why Another Media Player?
1. While there are numerous media players available, many of them are overly complicated with multiple screens, file browsers, background services, and advertisements. Feeling frustrated with this, I decided to create a simpler alternative.
2. With over 9 years of Android development experience, I had never attempted to implement a media player app. Thus, I decided to spend a couple of days experimenting with Jetpack Compose and Jetpack Media3 libraries.
